        Thank you for taking the time to help improve Zappr by sending us this report.

        **We recommend to not fill out this form manually.** If you're on this page after clicking "New issue", we instead recommend you to click the "Report via GitHub" button in the error window. By doing so, most of the form will be filled in automatically.

        **Before submitting this issue, however,** check that no one else has already reported the same problem. [Visit the Issues tab](https://github.com/ZapprTV/channels/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AError) and search for the name of the channel you want to report: if you don't find an issue with your same problem, continue filling out this form.

        **Also, please note that this form is only for channels that display an error window ("Channel error"). If the channel you want to report is causing problems but isn't displaying an error and is visibile, this is the wrong form.**
