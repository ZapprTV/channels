The channel logos, in PNG, WEBP and SVG format, and the channel lists, in JSON format, used by Zappr.

The channel lists follow the JSON Schema from [schema.json](schema.json), also available in Markdown format in [schema.md](schema.md).

The channel logos are in the `logos/` folder. In the root of a country's folder you'll find the high quality logos, in the highest resolution available, in PNG and SVG format.

Inside of a country's folder you'll also find the `optimized/` folder, which contains transformed and optimized versions of the logos in WEBP and SVG format, automatically generated by the [optimize-images](https://github.com/ZapprTV/optimize-images) GitHub Action. The Action transforms logos in PNG format to WEBP and resizes them to have a width of 300px, while the SVG ones just get compressed.

**Because the optimization is automatically done by the Action, when you open a pull request and add a logo, don't worry about optimizing or compressing it. Upload the highest quality version you can.**
